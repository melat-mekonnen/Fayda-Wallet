## üìò Project Synopsis

### üîç Problem Statement

Ethiopian citizens often rely on **physical Fayda ID cards** to access basic services like banking, telecom, and government offices. These cards can be easily forgotten, lost, or damaged ‚Äî and there's currently **no secure and user-friendly digital alternative**. Institutions also lack a fast, verifiable, and privacy-respecting way to confirm ID ownership in real time.

---

### üí° Planned Solution

We are building a **mobile wallet app** that allows users to store their Fayda ID digitally on their phone, protected by biometric login or PIN. The app generates a **secure QR code** that banks or institutions can scan to verify the user.

To enhance functionality and trust, we are adding:

- **Digital consent**: Users approve or deny each access attempt
- **Blockchain-style verification**: Each scan generates a verifiable hash stored in a tamper-proof log
- **Multi-ID support**: Store not just Fayda, but other essential IDs like driver‚Äôs license

---

### üéØ Expected Outcome

By the end of the hackathon, we expect to deliver:

- A functional mobile app that:

  - Stores Fayda ID data securely
  - Displays encrypted QR for verification
  - Uses biometric/PIN login for access
  - Supports digital consent and logging

- A working web verifier portal that:
  - Scans the QR code
  - Displays verified data from backend
  - Simulates ID verification

---

### ü™™ Fayda‚Äôs Role

Fayda is at the center of our solution. We are building a secure, accessible, and scalable interface around the Fayda ID system to:

- Promote **digital adoption** of national ID
- Enable secure and **real-time verification**
- Increase **citizen trust** in government-issued IDs
- Lay a foundation for **future integrations** (healthcare, education, elections)

This directly supports Ethiopia‚Äôs national goal of digital transformation and expands the usability of Fayda in everyday life.

   ```

### Environment Configuration

#### Firebase Configuration

The Firebase configuration is already set up in `lib/firebase_options.dart`. For production deployment, update the configuration with your actual Firebase project credentials:

```dart
// Update these values with your actual Firebase project configuration
static const FirebaseOptions web = FirebaseOptions(
  apiKey: 'your-actual-api-key',
  appId: 'your-actual-app-id',
  messagingSenderId: 'your-sender-id',
  projectId: 'your-project-id',
  authDomain: 'your-project.firebaseapp.com',
  storageBucket: 'your-project.appspot.com',
);
```

#### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables for production:

```bash
# API Configuration
API_BASE_URL=https://api.verifayda.com
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
OIDC_REDIRECT_URI=your_redirect_uri

# Firebase Configuration
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain

# Security
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

### VeriFayda OIDC Integration

This application integrates with VeriFayda OIDC as per hackathon requirements:

#### Authentication Flow
1. **User initiates login** - Clicks "Sign in with VeriFayda"
2. **OIDC Authorization** - App redirects to VeriFayda authorization server
3. **User Authentication** - User authenticates with VeriFayda credentials
4. **Authorization Code** - VeriFayda returns authorization code
5. **Token Exchange** - App exchanges code for access/ID tokens
6. **Firebase Integration** - Custom token created for Firebase authentication
7. **User Session** - User is signed in with verified Fayda ID data

#### Configuration
The VeriFayda integration is configured in `lib/features/auth/data/repositories/verifayda_auth_repository.dart`:

```dart
// VeriFayda OIDC Configuration
static const String _veriFaydaBaseUrl = 'https://api.verifayda.com';
static const String _clientId = 'digital_fayda_wallet_hackathon';
static const String _redirectUri = 'com.digitalfayda.wallet://auth/callback';
```

#### Security Features
- **Secure Token Storage** - All tokens stored using Flutter Secure Storage
- **Token Refresh** - Automatic token refresh when expired
- **Biometric Authentication** - Additional security layer with device biometrics
- **Session Management** - Proper session handling and cleanup

flutter test --coverage

# Run integration tests
flutter drive --target=test_driver/app.dart
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **Docker Build Fails**
   ```bash
   # Clear Docker cache and rebuild
   docker system prune -a
   docker-compose up --build --force-recreate
   ```

2. **Flutter Dependencies Issues**
   ```bash
   # Clean and reinstall dependencies
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Firebase Connection Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check Firebase configuration
   firebase projects:list
   firebase use your-project-id
   ```

4. **VeriFayda Authentication Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check network connectivity
   curl -I https://api.verifayda.com/health
   
   # Verify OIDC configuration
   flutter logs | grep "VeriFayda"
   ```

### Security Considerations

1. **HTTPS Configuration**
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Configure SSL certificates properly
   - Use HSTS headers (already configured in nginx)

2. **Data Protection**
   - All sensitive data is encrypted at rest
   - Biometric data never leaves the device
   - QR codes have short expiration times

3. **Firebase Security**
   - Review Firestore rules regularly
   - Enable audit logging
   - Use Firebase App Check in production

4. **VeriFayda Integration Security**
   - OIDC state and nonce parameters prevent CSRF attacks
   - Tokens are stored securely using device keychain
   - Regular token rotation and validation
   - Secure communication with HTTPS only
