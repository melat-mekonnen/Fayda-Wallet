## üìò Project Synopsis

### üîç Problem Statement

Ethiopian citizens often rely on **physical Fayda ID cards** to access basic services like banking, telecom, and government offices. These cards can be easily forgotten, lost, or damaged ‚Äî and there's currently **no secure and user-friendly digital alternative**. Institutions also lack a fast, verifiable, and privacy-respecting way to confirm ID ownership in real time.

## üöÄ Installation and Deployment

### Prerequisites

Before running the Digital Fayda Wallet application, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Flutter SDK** (v3.16.0 or later)
- **Dart SDK** (v3.0.0 or later)
- **Git** for cloning the repository
- **Android Studio** or **VS Code** with Flutter extensions
- **Firebase CLI** (for Firebase deployment)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd digital-fayda-wallet
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure FAN Integration**
   Update `lib/core/utils/app_constants.dart` with your FAN credentials:
   ```dart
   static const String fanOidcIssuer = 'https://fan.fayda.gov.et/auth/realms/fayda';
   static const String fanClientId = 'your_client_id';
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   # For development

  final authenticator = Authenticator(client, scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'fayda_id']);
  final credential = await authenticator.authorize();
  // Handle tokens and create Firebase session
}
```
