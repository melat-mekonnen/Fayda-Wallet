## üìò Project Synopsis

### üîç Problem Statement

Ethiopian citizens often rely on **physical Fayda ID cards** to access basic services like banking, telecom, and government offices. These cards can be easily forgotten, lost, or damaged ‚Äî and there's currently **no secure and user-friendly digital alternative**. Institutions also lack a fast, verifiable, and privacy-respecting way to confirm ID ownership in real time.

---

### üí° Planned Solution

We are building a **mobile wallet app** that allows users to store their Fayda ID digitally on their phone, protected by biometric login or PIN. The app generates a **secure QR code** that banks or institutions can scan to verify the user.

To enhance functionality and trust, we are adding:

- **Digital consent**: Users approve or deny each access attempt
- **Blockchain-style verification**: Each scan generates a verifiable hash stored in a tamper-proof log
- **Multi-ID support**: Store not just Fayda, but other essential IDs like driver‚Äôs license

---

### üéØ Expected Outcome

By the end of the hackathon, we expect to deliver:

- A functional mobile app that:

  - Stores Fayda ID data securely
  - Displays encrypted QR for verification
  - Uses biometric/PIN login for access
  - Supports digital consent and logging

- A working web verifier portal that:
  - Scans the QR code
  - Displays verified data from backend
  - Simulates ID verification

---

### ü™™ Fayda‚Äôs Role

Fayda is at the center of our solution. We are building a secure, accessible, and scalable interface around the Fayda ID system to:

- Promote **digital adoption** of national ID
- Enable secure and **real-time verification**
- Increase **citizen trust** in government-issued IDs
- Lay a foundation for **future integrations** (healthcare, education, elections)

This directly supports Ethiopia‚Äôs national goal of digital transformation and expands the usability of Fayda in everyday life.

## üöÄ Installation and Deployment

### Prerequisites

Before running the Digital Fayda Wallet application, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker** (v20.10 or later) and **Docker Compose** (v2.0 or later)
- **Git** for cloning the repository
- **Flutter SDK** (v3.16.0 or later) for local development
- **Firebase CLI** (optional, for Firebase deployment)

### Quick Start with Docker

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd digital-fayda-wallet
   ```

2. **Build and Run with Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   # Build and start all services
   docker-compose up --build
   
   # Or run in detached mode
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

3. **Access the Application**
   - **Web App**: http://localhost:3000
   - **Firebase Emulator UI**: http://localhost:4000
   - **API Health Check**: http://localhost/health

### Local Development Setup

#### Installing Dependencies

1. **Install Flutter Dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Enable Flutter Web Support**
   ```bash
   flutter config --enable-web
   ```

#### Running the App Locally

1. **Start Firebase Emulators (Optional)**
   ```bash
   firebase emulators:start
   ```

2. **Run the Flutter Web App**
   ```bash
   flutter run -d web-server --web-hostname 0.0.0.0 --web-port 8080
   ```

### Production Deployment

#### Option 1: Docker Deployment

1. **Build the Production Image**
   ```bash
   docker build -t digital-fayda-wallet:latest .
   ```

2. **Run the Production Container**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 80:80 digital-fayda-wallet:latest
   ```

#### Option 2: Firebase Hosting

1. **Build the Web App**
   ```bash
   flutter build web --release
   ```

2. **Deploy to Firebase Hosting**
   ```bash
   firebase login
   firebase init hosting
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```

### Environment Configuration

#### Firebase Configuration

Create a `lib/firebase_options.dart` file with your Firebase project configuration:

```dart
// This file should contain your Firebase configuration
// Generated by running: flutter packages pub run firebase_tools:generate_config
```

#### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables for production:

```bash
# API Configuration
API_BASE_URL=https://api.verifayda.com
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
OIDC_REDIRECT_URI=your_redirect_uri

# Firebase Configuration
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain

# Security
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

### Testing the Application

#### Manual Testing Checklist

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - [ ] VeriPayda OIDC login works
   - [ ] Biometric authentication functions
   - [ ] User can logout successfully

2. **Wallet Functionality**
   - [ ] Fayda ID displays correctly
   - [ ] QR code generation works
   - [ ] QR code expires after 5 minutes

3. **Security Features**
   - [ ] Data is encrypted locally
   - [ ] Biometric prompts appear
   - [ ] Session management works

4. **UI/UX**
   - [ ] App loads within 3 seconds
   - [ ] Responsive design works on mobile/desktop
   - [ ] Ethiopian flag colors are consistent

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **Docker Build Fails**
   ```bash
   # Clear Docker cache and rebuild
   docker system prune -a
   docker-compose up --build --force-recreate
   ```

2. **Flutter Dependencies Issues**
   ```bash
   # Clean and reinstall dependencies
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Firebase Connection Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check Firebase configuration
   firebase projects:list
   firebase use your-project-id
   ```

### Security Considerations

1. **HTTPS Configuration**
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Configure SSL certificates properly
   - Use HSTS headers (already configured in nginx)

2. **Data Protection**
   - All sensitive data is encrypted at rest
   - Biometric data never leaves the device
   - QR codes have short expiration times

3. **Firebase Security**
   - Review Firestore rules regularly
   - Enable audit logging
   - Use Firebase App Check in production
